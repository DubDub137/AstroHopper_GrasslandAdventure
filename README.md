# Astro Hopper: Grassland Adventure

## Introduction

Astro Hopper: Grassland Adventure is a simple platformer game project created using the Pygame library in Python. In the game, the player takes on the role of a space hopper character who must jump over obstacles and collect points by hopping on the grassy ground. The goal of the project is to demonstrate basic mechanics of creating platformer games, such as character control, jumping, obstacle avoidance, point collection, and the creation of character and enemy animations in the game.

## Technologies

Below is a list of the libraries and modules used in the project:

-   **pygame**: A library for creating games in Python. It provides functions for rendering graphics, handling sound, managing events, creating animations, and interacting with the user.

In addition, the following standard Python modules were used:

-   **sys**: A module that contains various functions and variables related to the Python interpreter. In the project, it was used to exit the game when the window is closed.
-   **math**: A module that contains mathematical functions. In the project, it was used for rounding numerical values.
-   **random**: A module that enables generating random numbers. In the project, it was used for randomly selecting enemies.
-   **time**: A module that provides functions related to time. In the project, it was used for delays and counting game time.

The code for Astro Hopper: Grassland Adventure is compatible with Python 3.11, but it should also work correctly in other versions of Python.

The game is saved in a file named "astro_hopper.py", which contains the entire game code along with the necessary imports of the mentioned libraries and modules.

## Running the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1.  Install Python 3.11 on your system.
2.  Install the Pygame library by executing the command: `pip install pygame`.
3.  Download the project source code from the repository.
4.  Run the `astro_hopper.py` file using the Python interpreter.

## Game Instructions

1.  Upon launching the game, you will see a start screen with three different characters to choose from: a blue, pink, and yellow space hopper.
2.  Click the left mouse button on one of the characters to select your hopper.
3.  After selecting a character, the gameplay will begin.
4.  Control the hopper by using the spacebar - press the spacebar to jump.
5.  Avoid obstacles that will appear on your path. You can jump over obstacles to bypass them.
6.  Collect as many points as possible before colliding with an obstacle. The game ends upon collision.
7.  Your points will be displayed on the end screen.
8.  You can try again by clicking on a character or quit the game by closing the window.
